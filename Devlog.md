2/13/25 - 2 hr
Started Project, began researching basics on 3D printers, watched Youtube videos and builds

2/14/25 - 1 hr
Continued basic research, began thinking about design requirements, studied other DIY 3D printers

2/15/25 - 3 hr
Watched more YT videos on 3D printers, researched and created BOM for toolhead, began importing models to CAD. Time was spread out throughout the day

2/16/25 - 3 hr
Finished draft of BOM, began cadding mounts etc to connect everything together (spent an hour trying to find a 3d model of carto. probe to no avail)

2/17/25 - 2 hr
Continued working on toolhead, began thinking about frame and movement system

2/18/25 - 1hr 30m
Researched and worked on frame design. Spent wayyy to long creating a linear rail model.

2/23/25 - 2hr 30m
Struggled to download and use autodesk cdf. When I finally began running simulations, they were all completely goofed. Notably:

3/4/25 - 1hr 30m
Settled on frame designl, bedslinger. Began working on X axis mount and belt drive.

3/8/25 - 2hr 30m
Locked in on CFD, created first two iterations of my first design, a 2 stream blower funnel.
V1:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fb6bbf-abf5-4dd4-85ee-c999e6ce05dc)
V2:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e30228c6-5c0f-4b0e-804d-912f68678d95)
Both completely missed the nozzle end ._.

3/9/25 - 3hr
Finished second version of the double funnel, promising first results

Finished the frame and brackets for all 3 axis. The printer's really starting to come together.

3/11/25 - 1hr
Began researching for beds and electronics
Finished X and Z movement systems (specifically belt mounts)
Build volume is currently looking to be around 19 x 25 x 16 (xyz), which I'll definitely have to look into tomorrow. One way is to cut down the Y axis by 5, which brings the volume to a fairly square 19x20x16
